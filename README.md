### Description
CollabCart is a grocery list app that allows users to add and remove items from a list in real time. 

### Goal
To develop a full stack application that provides an in/out RESTful API in JSON. 

### Technologies used
* React.JS
* Node.JS
* Express
* Postgres
* Sequelize ORM
* Bootstrap Styling
* Jasmine TDD CRUD Testing
* Google OAuth 2.0 

### Tech Trade Offs 
* Google OAuth used in place of bare bones log in sessions. Trade off is that there is no need to store extra info like passwords and user names. Only being stored in User model is email from google.
